# How to work with Dylan Lafferty
---

## Personality

My name is Dylan Lafferty, I am 21 years old and am working towards becoming a Software Engineer.

## Daily Requirements
These are a few requirements for me to be prepared to have a good day at work.

- I need a full nights rest or else I'll be a little cranky.
- I need at least 100mg of caffeine in the morning to add a little pump to my step.
- I like to be friendly and have a good time while working so I like subtle jokes to keep the good spirits flowing.
- I need either lunch or breakfast to keep my mind focused.
- I require a clean workspace. If there is too much clutter my brain will not focus on anything besides that until it is gone.

## Ways to Reach me outside and inside of the workplace.

I am always available and checking my email, feel free to send me emails or even send over a direct message on Google Chats as well. I am not afraid of some camera time either so if you prefer a zoom call we can set one up as well. I however do not have a phone number so those are the only ways I am available.

I am more of the quiet behind the scenes kind of person at the beginning but soon will become a talker. None the less I am always willing to share and collaborate, I just might need a little push to spark up a conversation with me but I am always ready.

## Ways I like to help others

- I like to attempt to help others grasp a better understanding of what is required of an assignment when I understand something or am ahead of schedule.
- I like to teach others keyboard shortcuts or other life hacks they might not have known before hand.

## A main goal of mine for the year of 2025

I want to be able to **never** have to work at a restuarant again.

## Topics I like talking about

  - Programming
  - Modern Day Problems
  - Conspiracy Theorys
  - Video Games
  - Cooking
