# A'nanatawa McIntyre's README

## Introduction

A'nanatawa means The Cosmic Mother Has Returned. I landed here in 1995 and have dedicated almost 2 decades of my existence to serving the community of Wilmington, Delaware alongside my family. I grew up in Mollys Old Fashioned Icecream: My grandmother's 50s-60s themed ice cream parlor established in 1999. In 2010, at the age of 15, I helped my mom, Abundance Child, experiment with making "meats" and vegan cheeses, and within two years we turned the family ice cream shop into Drop Squad Kitchen, Delaware's first vegan restaurant. In 2024, I became Vendor Coordinator for the 30th Annual Peoples Festival Tribute to Bob Marley and, currently in 2025, I've started to take the steps towards learning code so that I can build my own app. 

## My Work Ethic:

1. In general, I am someone that can and will be ready to go at any time of the day if it's for the better of the whole. I do prefer to meet in the mornings after 9am and no later than 4pm. The evenings are reserved for family time. 
2. I enjoy working on solo projects, where I am given a clear task and tools to complete that task. I also find enjoyment in group projects, as long as we're all equally doing our part and each person is compatible with the other.
3. I absolutely love communicating through email and text. As someone that has used computers since a young age, I find fun in any opportunity to type on a keyboard and love the professionalism that you can carry when it comes to email.
4. Meeting new people and helping them brings me joy. I thrive in receptionist roles, where I am delegated tasks and am the face of the company that I serve. People naturally come to me for advice, which I am more than happy to help with.


## My Opinions on Feedback:
Feedback is absolutely necessary and I am thankful to receive it face to face, rather than post- it notes left on the fridge lol. I am a visual learner, so when shown the correct way, I know exactly where I went wrong and the information sticks. When giving feedback, I prefer to communicate with my peers or staff through email or our work app, so as not to sugar coat, be very clear and consice about what needs fixing, and can take my time doing so. 

## Where to reach me:

In person: Catch me sitting on a rock by the river, feet in the water, watching the ducks in their habitat. I'm almost always at Drop Squad Kitchen, making food from scratch or with my family netflix and chilling it at home. 

In the digital world: If you know me personally, you'll almost always find me on Instagram . If you're lucky and come across one of my many accounts, you may be able to find me on Reddit, tumblr, and Youtube. To reach me professionally and urgently, shoot me an email and I'll get back to you within 24 hours.

## How To Build A Good Relationship With Me:

Be authentic, open, and inquisitive. Invite me to work on a project together with you or a study session. I'll take that as you wanting to get to know me. I am a Scorpio, with a Virgo rising and Capricorn sun that enjoys a natural flow of conversation-- nothing forced. I love a good sense of humor and down to mars people. Be honest and upfront with me, as I'll be with you. On lunch break, let's go for a walk or do some physical activity together. Being kind and good goes a long way with me. 

## Some Fun Facts:
- My perfect place is by a rainy window, with a warm blanket, drinking some tea or coffee with a good book in hand.

- One of my favorite past times is scouring Youtube for rare 90s house music, unheard J Dilla beats, and obscure video game music.
- I love classic horror movies such as, The Evil Dead (1981), Halloween (1978), and Rosemary's Baby (1968).
- I have 2 black cats named Nine and Ninja.
- My first experience with social media was Myspace, when I was 12.
- The first instrument I learned to play was the saxophone.
