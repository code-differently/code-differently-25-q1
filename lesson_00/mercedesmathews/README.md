## About Me
I am 23 years old and just graduated from the University of Delaware with a Computer Science degree. I was a gymnast for about 17 years and started when I was 18 months. I taught gymnastics for over 7 years and was a Tech Lead with Code Differently for almost 2 years. 

## Working With Me
I am a night owl even though my schedule doesn't reflect that currently. I prefer working and talking in person but I am best reached via the google chat or text. I'm a bit more of a visual learner so videos and diagrams are my go to.

## My Current Schedule
1. Wake up and get prepped for the day (6:00am - 6:30am)
2. Go to the gym (About 7:00am - 8:30am)
    * Weightlifting / Strength
3. Go to class (9:00am - 5:00pm)
    * Stay after if needed (up until 7:00pm)
4. Go to the gym again (30 - 60 mins)
    * Cardio / Endurance
5. Go home (yay :smile:)
