### Availability

I'm always available from 9a-5p if you have any questions feel free to approach me. You can contact me through our Google Chat or if you need you can privately message me my DMs are always open.

Currently my Monday and Friday evenings are quite busy because that's when I'm usually working but I usually try to reply as soon as I get home at 11p. If I don't get to replying I'll definitely answer in the morning.

### My Workflow

I'm a very hands on and visual learner. If you give me instruction and I'm unsure how to execute it. I would need some sort of demonstration or some kind of draft of what you want me to do. Although, usually I'm able to visualize it in my head that gets my mind flowing.



### Feedback

If I'm doing anything wrong or if you have a method to complete the task more efficiently please feel free to critique my work in any way you see fit. I'm open to hearing feedback **anytime** 

I'm here to learn to work towards a Career in software I'm open for any criticisms and suggestions.

Now as far as me giving or suggesting advice. I'll always first ask why you did something in one way rather than another. It's usually just me being curious. I want you to explain the thought process behind why you did something the way you did. I might further suggest another method which is a method I would use it may or may not be "better" or efficient but I always encourage you to do whatever makes you comfortable. I just like throwing ideas out there to give you more options.

### Getting to know me

I'm a car guy I love talking about cars or motorsport whether that be Formula 1, Rally, or Formula Drift. My favorite drivers include Yuki Tsunoda, Alex Albon, and Keiichi Tsuchiya.

I was on the swimming and volleyball team in highschool. Although, I'm not very good I find both sports very fun!
