# The mundane life of John W. Bey

## Who am I?

Originally born and raised in Philly, I am simply someone looking for an opportunity in what I can only describe to be my passion. That passion is finally becoming a software enginner. Or at least,
using whatever knowledge I can gain to finally pursue the projects that I want to pursue.

## What I like

- Money
- Pets
- Females
- Computers
- Lemons
- Anime & video games

## What I hate

I hate potatoes being put on top of my pizza.

## What am I like?

I'm a chill person. I don't like to cause trouble for anyone that's around me. In fact, I'd like to avoid that as much as possible. I'm also disciplined when it comes to things that I really want.

## Any controversial opinions?

- Samsung is better than iPhone.
- Comic books look ugly.
- Zendaya isn't all that.
