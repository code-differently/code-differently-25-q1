### My Daily requirements
As an early bird person. I usually start my days waking up before the crack of dawn. It tends to usually have something for me to process. As in a certain way of thinking to reach, which I do by usually challenging my mind in such ways as exercise, prayer, reading, and solitude for mental clarity. I am a bit of a picky eater. But 1 to 2 meals a day should do the job for the most of the time. I dont usually drink anyhting but water. So as long as i have access to I am fine. I do like my space through out the day here and there to make through. By any means necessary do I need a nap if I were to get overstimulated at any point. I do love to work on music as I also have my own studio. When it comes down to my time this is still a priority for me after my list for the day is knocked out. 

### Whats the best way to communicate with me?

Tho Id usually identify as an intro extrovert, I am pretty open availble as a person. Depending on the realtionship stuatus, If you do have my number perferebally, Id like to be reached out through text first and if no answer than phone call. I dont mind answering the phone most of the time i just like to be forewarned prior to the conversation. If im not busy then of course, feel free to contact. Out side of the phone i am available via email, whats app.
