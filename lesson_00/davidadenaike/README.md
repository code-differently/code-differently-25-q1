# How to work with David Adenaike 
*Document helps others better understand me. From important facts about me to fun facts* 
## My work hours 
I perfer to work early morning to mid afternoon. Granted I am a naturally a night owl but ive been trying to be more of a morning person. Others should expect to work with me during the morning and noon. I most times am unavailable during the weekend and late evenings.
## Whats the best way to communicate with me?
Best way to contact me is via text messages. I might not reply right away but it is the most reliable way to get in touch with me quickly. While working I perfer chats (slack, teams, etc),I try not to meet in-person unless absolutely necessary. Only because I can be antisocial at times. Most times it is okay to interrupt me when I have headphones, Ill let you know if otherwise.
## I'd love to help you with 
Anything you are genuinely passionate about! It rejuvenates me seeing others passionate about their interests/hobby. I might not be good at what you are passionate about, but would still like to help if needed.
## What makes me grumpy
Biggest one for me is hyprocrisy in others. Besides that general unexpected changes gets me grumpy as well.
## How do I like to give feedback
I like listing things that worked well and that didn't work well as feedback. Along with recommended ways to improve. Generally would like to give feedback in person
## How do I like to receive feedback?
I dont have a preference as to how I receive feedback. I just want the feedback to be very percise. What and how I can work on to become better.

Biggest goal I have is to break into tech.
