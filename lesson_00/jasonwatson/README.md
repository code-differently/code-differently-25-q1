## About Me

I first fell in love with computers before they became an household item in my country.My love started from a curiosity to understand how things worked , what made them go, and what made them stop working. My first lessons in tech were from simple self taugh research and over the years my love grew and my path was established.
  I am a Computer and Network technician with little over ten (10) years experince. Most of my work experiece was in Jamaica. I've worked with multiple companies to include the Jamaica Constabulary Force. In the year 2020 I started my own Tech Company called Chief IT Consulting. We specialise in computer and network repair and service. I've worked on a few machines such as DEll, HP, Lenovo, ASUS and a few more. But my main passion is being a Network Technician. Working with Juniper, CISCO and UNIFI hards is really cool. My enjoy come from bulding able to see what i've built. And the work it took.
Currently I'm in the process of learning to code at Code Differently. With the goal to increase my Tech skills to open up new opportunities. I'm in the process of learning the basics, even thought challenging I'm willing to give it my all.
