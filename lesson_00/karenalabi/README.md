# Hi everyone, I'm Karen! 


## A little bit about me...
Currently, I serve as an Aircraft Electrical and Environmental Systems Engineer in the Air Force Reserves, where I play a key role in maintaining the electrical and environmental systems of aircraft, ensuring their safety and efficiency. This includes troubleshooting, removing, and replacing malfunctioning components, as well as performing cryogenic maintenance on mobile aircraft servicing units. My work in the Air Force is incredibly fulfilling and allows me to stay at the cutting edge of technology while also serving my country. The process of actively working through complex challenges and visually seeing solutions unfold is what excites me the most. I’m always eager to take on the next problem, whether that’s ensuring the optimal functioning of aircraft systems or crafting something from scratch.

Beyond engineering, I have diverse interests that keep me constantly exploring new ideas. Faith and fashion are two other areas that hold a special place in my life. I often spend my free time watching Christian music or podcasts to deepen my spiritual understanding, while I also enjoy browsing sewing tutorials and finding my next DIY project. Whether I’m crocheting, knitting, or styling a new outfit, I love the creative process. Fashion, for me, is about more than just clothes; it’s an art form that allows me to express myself in unique ways.

Traveling is another passion of mine — I’ve visited six countries so far, and Paris,France is by far my favorite. Each new place offers a unique perspective, and I love immersing myself in different cultures through conversation, food, and experiences. Learning new languages is also something I’m committed to, with Mandarin currently being one of the languages I’m tackling. 

I would describe myself as a detail-oriented person who thrives in collaborative environments. Whether working on a team or independently, I always strive to bring my best to every project and continue to learn and grow. Looking forward to collaborating!
