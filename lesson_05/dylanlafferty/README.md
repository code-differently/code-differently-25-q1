    1. As a `Line Cook`, `I want ` an application that allows me to see an easy-to-read ticket that only displays items that belong to my station on that ticket. `So that` I can quickly make entrees faster and be able to focus on what is on my stations end other than the other stations.

    2. As a `Software engineer`, `I want` a program that will allow me to drag and drop different css elements, `So that` I can efficently create a custom webpage without having to spend hours making the perfect CSS.

    3. As a `Inventory Stock`, `I want` a program that will keep track of items in my storage and when that item hits a certain number it will automatically send order. `So that` I can automate my storage process and spend time reordering on other tasks in the store.
