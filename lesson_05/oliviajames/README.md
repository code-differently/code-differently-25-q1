## User Story 1
- As an Emergency Room Physician, when entering a patient’s chart I want to have access to the nurses most up to date charting notes in accordance with recent orders so that I am able to be up to date with my patients most current status.


## User Story 2 
- As an Animator when designing I like to have multiple design tools located on the screen so that I don’t have to waste time going back and forth between a “Tool” button.


## User Story 3
- As a healthcare administrator it is beneficial to be able to hover over a patients name in the search bar to confirm the patients PHI so it doesn’t have to take up my entire screen and can ensure I’m choosing the right patient in my search of names.
