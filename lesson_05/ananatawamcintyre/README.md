# User Stories and Responses for Reddit 

**Background:** Reddit is a website, mobile app, and social media platform that allows users to interact and comment within multiple communities and make photo-video-text content. Reddit utilizes upvotes, downvotes, and a point system, called karma, which is displayed on every profile. If your karma is low or negative (in the 100s or 1000s for example) it signifies to the reddit world that you are either a brand new user, don't use reddit often, or are an internet troll. If your karma is high (10,000+) it signifies that you have made viral, popular posts or comments in the past and, most likely, are a decent redditor. New users, or users with low karma, cannot comment or make posts on Reddit until their account is at least (1) day old.

**User Story 1:**

As a brand new reddit user, I want the ability to make a comment or post so that I can participate in the community conversation. 

**Response/Acceptance Criteria:**
- The update will allow new users to comment and post within communities even when their account is less than a day old. 
- The system now incorporates a trigger word function that will auto-ban trolls when commenting or posting those words, but will allow new users with low karma to still make posts and comments.
- The block against new or low karma users will be lifted from the website and mobile app, allowing anyone to interact on the website.


**User Story 2:**

I am a moderator that would like to respond to ModMail as myself, not as a Moderator, so that I can form a personal connection with the sender. 

**Response/Acceptance Criteria:**
- When the moderator enters the ModMail to respond to a message, there will be an option to respond anonymously as a "Moderator" or  as their personal account. 
- The system will allow the moderator to craft their own private, additional message to the messenger that other Moderators cannot see or have access to.
- The Modmail update will provide a checkbox that allows the Moderator to send an automatic friend request and inbox inquiry to the messenger so that the two people can form their own relationship. 



**User Story 3:**

I am non-frequent user that would like to have full access to the website so that I can participate in discussions quickly. 

**Response/Acceptance Criteria:**

- The software will allow users to comment as a "Guest" on reddit without needing to sign up to the website. 
- The new update will allow Guest users to not only make their own posts, but also give them the opportunity to sign up and make their account official after making said post.
- The website will now give the Guest user an option to add their cellphone or email address so that they get notified if anyone responds to their post.
