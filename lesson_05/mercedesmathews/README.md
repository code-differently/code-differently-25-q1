# User stories for a music platform when walking and running

- As a runner, I want an app to track how fast i'm running, so that it can play music that matches my pace.
- As a spotify listener, I want the app to link with my spotify, so that it can play music from my own playlists.
- As a user, I want to add my music preferences, so that the app can generate music based off of them.
