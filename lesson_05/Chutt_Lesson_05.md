1.) As an online shopper, I want to use a payment method that is not attached to any of my personal information including my address.

* Response: Create an encrypyted drop box system where the shopper can purchase the drop box with cash or a prepaid card and then use an encrypted bar code or QR code to order items that will be sent to the drop box location.

2.) As a manager, I want to ensure that my employees are completing their daily notes by end of shift to be in compliance.

* Response: Create a plug in into the clock in/clock out feature of the company’s software system so that when the employee is getting ready to clock out a pop up screen will appear that will allow the employee to complete daily notes. The employee won’t be able to clock out unless the daily note is completed.

3.) As an employee, I want to stay on task with workflow assignments throughout the day. Daily tasks are assigned, and I want to complete them all before EOD.

* Response: Create a company-based app or device that operates as a task manager and alarm system. Once employee clocks in as on duty, a daily task list will generate according to position and alarms will be set for every hour to remind employee of task.
