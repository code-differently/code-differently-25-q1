# Backend JavaScript

As a day competitive player, I want everything in the game to work as smoothly and seamlessly as possible, so that I may increase my rank fairly and without any interruptions.


## Acceptance Criteria

Given the game properly reads my input in real-time when I press the shoot button, then the person on the other side takes damage and dies.


# HTML/CSS

As a day to day user, I want the website to be easy to read, so that I can digest the information on it more thoroughly.


## Acceptance Criteria

Given the information on the website is very easily understood when I decide to more thoroughly read it, then the time that I save when doing so will be cut in half and just overall be more accurate.


# Python

As a person just getting into python, I want to create a python script that automatically webscrapes Amazon for the highest priced GPUs, so that I can buy them quickly and sell them to the highest bidder.


## Acceptance Criteria

Given Python takes the price of a certain GPUs when I run the command, then the price will be put into my database and the item will be bought before anyone else.
