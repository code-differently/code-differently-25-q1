    <h1>Knowing Nia</h1> 
    <p>How to work with Nia P.</p> 

    <h2>My work hours:</h2>
    <p>I am a morning person. Specifically early morning, between 3 & 8am is my usual leisure time. Colleagues should expect to work with me during most business hours, 9am to 6pm. I am available Monday through Friday during those times. I don't prefer to work weekends but I will make an exception on Saturdays. Sundays are strictly forbidden for work.</p>

    <h2>What’s the best way to communicate with me?</h2>
    <p>I prefer to email on certain topics in order to have a paper trail, but I am open to communication through text message if needed. I prefer in-person meetings over chats and Zoom. It is OK to interrupt when I have headphones on. If I don’t respond try calling me on my cell phone.</p>

    <h2>How did my interest in tech start?</h2>
    <p>I was interested in code and decided to enroll in a CS50 class with Harvard. I learned a few fundamentals but overall it was too fast-paced. I then did a course at SNHU wanting to major in Cyber Security, but came to the conclusion that I would prefer to learn in person.</p>

    <h2>What makes me grumpy?</h2>
    <p>I'm usually grumpy when I'm hungry and/or tired.</p>

    <h2>How do I like to give feedback?</h2>
    <p>I prefer to give feedback in person, this way there is no way to misinterpret my tone and my delivery. Which is easy to do when reading.</p>

    <h2>How do I like to receive feedback?</h2>
    <p>I prefer feedback in-person because it's more personable but I'm open to email. I would like feedback as frequently as once a week. More if needed.</p>

    <h2>One of my goals for the coming year:</h2>
    <p>This year one of my goals is to become fluent in code and its terminology. Another goal is to travel out of my country.</p>

    <h2>Topics I’m always happy to talk about:</h2>
    <p>I'm always happy to talk about my experiences in life. The places I've lived, previous jobs and places I've traveled. I also love talking about my children.</p>
