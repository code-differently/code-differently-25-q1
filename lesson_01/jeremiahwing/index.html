    <h3>Get To Know Jeremiah Wing</h3>

    <h3>My daily requirements</h3>
    <p>As an early bird person. I usually start my days waking up before the crack of dawn. It tends to usually have something for me to process. As in a certain way of thinking to reach, which I do by usually challenging my mind in such ways as exercise, prayer, reading, and solitude for mental clarity. I am a bit of a picky eater. But 1 to 2 meals a day should do the job for the most of the time. I don't usually drink anything but water. So as long as I have access to it, I am fine. I do like my space throughout the day here and there to make through. By any means necessary do I need a nap if I were to get overstimulated at any point. I do love to work on music as I also have my own studio. When it comes down to my time, this is still a priority for me after my list for the day is knocked out.</p>

    <h3>What's the best way to communicate with me?</h3>
    <p>Though I'd usually identify as an intro-extrovert, I am pretty open and available as a person. Depending on the relationship status, if you do have my number, preferably, I'd like to be reached out through text first, and if no answer, then phone call. I don't mind answering the phone most of the time; I just like to be forewarned prior to the conversation. If I'm not busy, then of course, feel free to contact. Outside of the phone, I am available via email, WhatsApp, or social media. Rarely in person unless already accepted request.</p>

    <h3>I'd love to help you with___</h3>
    <p>Being fully authentic as your person. Embracing you and mastering levels of solitude. Understanding more of yourself, loving all your flaws. I also am very humorous, so I love to bring people down to earth, making them feel good and have a good time while being the best or better version of themselves.</p>

    <h3>What makes me upset/grumpy?</h3>
    <p>I have been working on my temperament my whole entire life. As I got older, I have learned to cope with my emotions and connect them to my drive. I understand that most of the time, I'm angry because of disappointment. However, there are always things to set off your trigger. Not enough rest, not enough food, and hydration. As a creative, I need to express myself as much as possible.</p>

    <h3>How do I like to give feedback?</h3>
    <p>I usually give feedback only when recommended. But I'd like to give feedback to people who wanted it from me first. Only when a person is receptive.</p>

    <h3>How do I like to receive feedback?</h3>
    <p>I like to converse or do it in person if anything; I can read body language and mannerisms.</p>
