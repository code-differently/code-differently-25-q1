<p>Hello, I am Chanel Hutt, a Delaware native. I love me. I hope you love you too. I am believer of energy and positivity. I developed a knack for optimism and adventure in my youth. 
 
<h3> How we can work well together:</h3>
<p>My work preferences are communicate respectively and be positive. I am a soluton-based individual. I typically emphasize ways to solve an issue rather then giving life to the problem. In my opinion, conflicts or disputes should be handled like a pro/con list. Once you understand that everyone has different perspectives and analytical skills conflicts would be less likely to arise. Just be mindful we are all humans and deserved to be heard.</p> 

<h3>My dream schedule:</h3>
<p>I am a morning person but I can do nights. <em>Have it my way, I would only work Tuesday thru Thursday 7am - 7pm.</em> What you will expect from me during in-office workdays are warm greetings, readiness and humor. I am available during my scheduled business hours .</p>
