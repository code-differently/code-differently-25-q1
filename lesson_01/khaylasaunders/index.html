<h1><strong>Howdy, I'm Khayla Saunders</strong>&nbsp;🤠👩🏾‍💻</h1>
<h2>Welcome to my Git Crib!</h2>
<p>Feel free to call me Khai! I love having sidebar chit-chats to make connections, laugh, and work hard. Integrity is essential to me. One of my favorite quotes is from the GOAT Lebron "I know we're out [of]  the playoff race, but if I'm on the court, I'm going to play how I play, and I play to win. So, I <strong>never will cheat the game </strong>..."</p>
<h3> A few not so essential, basics</h3>
<ul>
<li>I use she/her/hers pronouns</li>
<li>3x Gen Philadelphian! GO BIRDS! (Still learning football...BUT I frequent West Point games to support my little BIG cousin!)</li>
<li>I can get a little southern, I went to undergrad at THE BEST HBCU, Tuskegee University</li>
<li> I earned my Master's in  Historic Preservation from the University of Pennsylvania, where I enjoyed breaking traditional norms to save Black Philly Gems...check out my work with the <a href=(https://www.inquirer.com/arts/tanner-house-community-outreach-report-20240910.html)>Tanner House!</a></li>
<li>I need my Mushroom Coffee Daily (Everyday Doze) 🍄 </li>

</ul>
<h4>Work Routine</h4>
<p>I am at my best in the mornings, and Ready to chat about work from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m.</p>
<h4>Best Way to communicate </h4>
<ul>
    <li><span>Email:</span> For non-urgent but more extended questions, it helps me process more efficiently and think through the problem better.</li>
    <li><span>Google Chat:</span> Best for casual or quick questions and/or conversations.</li>
    <li><span>In-person:</span> MY FAVORITE!</li>
</ul>
<blockquote><span>ALSO</span> Feel Free to tap me, even if I have headphones on (I prefer to work with something in the background).
</blockquote>
<h4>How do I like to give feedback? </h4>
<p>I want to meet in person, but if it's easier, I can email you. I'm always taking notes that I can share.</p>
<h4>How do I like to receive feedback? </h4>
<p>In-person is best, but if you don't have any time, email/Google chat is best. </p>
<h4>My Goal for this year </h4>
<p>I want continuous growth in my faith, to become a software engineer, to go on one international trip, and to keep learning to remain a service person.</p>
