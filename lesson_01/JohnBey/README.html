            <h2>Who am I?</h2>
            <p>Originally born and raised in Philly, I am simply someone looking for an opportunity in what I can only describe to be my passion. That passion is finally becoming a software engineer. Or at least, using whatever knowledge I can gain to finally pursue the projects that I want to pursue.</p>

            <h2>What I like</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Money. Need that in order to do anything, ESPECIALLY the things that I WANT to do.</li>
                <li>Pets. I want an attack dog. The dogs that I've taken care of in the past weren't exactly attack-dog capable (I miss them ðŸ˜¢).</li>
                <li>Females. Self-explanatory.</li>
                <li>Computers. But only when they work. I don't want to even look at a computer when it's having personal issues.</li>
                <li>Lemons. This is just my weird guilty pleasure.</li>
                <liAnime & video games. I probably don't watch or play the same things that most people play, but that's fine. This is definitely one of my main hobbies. The 2 main games I do play are called Super Smash Bros. Ultimate and Splatoon 3.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>What I hate</h2>
            <p>I hate potatoes on top of my pizza. I hate when my phone decides to act slow for no reason. I hate Twitter. I hate, HATE losing when competing seriously. Even when I'm not competing seriously, losing just irks me the wrong way.</p>

            <h2>What am I like?</h2>
            <p>I'm a chill person. I don't like to cause trouble for anyone that's around me. In fact, I'd like to avoid that as much as possible. I'm also disciplined when it comes to things that I really want. I don't really like to talk when I'm trying really hard to understand something, but I will help others if the need arises. Sometimes I can come off as too passive or too abrasive. It's hard to balance the two sometimes. But overall, I'm just another normal dude.</p>

            <h2>Any controversial opinions?</h2>

                <li>Samsung is better than iPhone.</li>
                <li>Comic books look ugly.</li>
                <li>Video games don't make people violent.</li>
            </ul>

They're both really my work email to be honest.</p>
