        <h2>Personality</h2>

        <h2>Daily Requirements</h2>
        <hr>

        <p>These are a few requirements for me to be prepared to have a good day at work.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>I need a full nights rest or else I'll be a little cranky</li>
            <li>I need at least 100mg of caffeine in the morning to add a little pump to my step.</li>
            <li>I like to be friendly and have a good time while working so I like subtle jokes to keep the good spirits flowing.</li>
            <li>I need either lunch or breakfast to keep my mind focused.</li>
            <li>I require a clean workspace. If there is too much clutter my brain will not focus on anything besides that until it is gone.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Ways to reach me outside and inside of the workplace</h2>
        <hr>

        <p>I am always available and checking my email, feel free to send me emails or even send over a direct message on Google Chats as well.<br>
          I am not afraid of some camera time either so if you prefer a zoom call we can set one up as well. I however do not have a phone number so those are the only ways I am available.
        </p>

        <p>I am more of the quiet behind the scenes kind of person at the beginning but soon will become a talker. None the less I am always willing to share and collaborate, I just might need a little push to spark up a conversation with me but I am always ready.</p>
