  <h2>Best ways to reach me</h2>
  <hr>
  <p>Not an early bird at all. preferably not mornings but if it has to be a morning after 9am. Email is the most formal way to reach me but a text would always be the quickest. (im a 2000's baby so text is what i grew up with) Also another way is by a social media dm. I check all my streams of communication daily but you will most likely get an answer quicker on an off day through a text.</p>
