Python examples

```python
def is_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n**0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

# Example usage
num = 29
if is_prime(num):
    print(f"{num} is a prime number.")
else:
    print(f"{num} is not a prime number.")
```
  
  
Java Examples

```java
    public class PrimeChecker {
    public static boolean isPrime(int n) {
        if (n < 2) return false;
        for (int i = 2; i <= Math.sqrt(n); i++) {
            if (n % i == 0) return false;
        }
        return true;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int num = 29;
        System.out.println(num + " is prime: " + isPrime(num));
    }
}
```

Similarties 
They both use if and for standards to go about the command. This essentially gives the computer a path to go through to make sure the number is prime or not. They also both use the true and false function. This tells the computer how to go about the next commands. Also they both use division. Division is important because if it can be di
vided or not crtical in figuring out if the number is prime.

Differences
A big difference is in the certain command language used. Examples begin in how they start. Java begins with public static and python begins with def is prime. This continues all throughout the code line with multiple commands being different.
